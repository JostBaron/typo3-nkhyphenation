                    By default, only the soft hyphen and the zero width joiner
                    (U+200D) are considered to be the characters that can make
                    up a word. You can add additional characters making up words
                    here. These characters are used additionally to the ones
                    defined in the pattern file. If the pattern file does not
                    contain a specification which characters do make up words in
                    the language, you have to set word characters here.
