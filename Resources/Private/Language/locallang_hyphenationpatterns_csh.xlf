                    By default, only the soft hyphen and the zero width joiner
                    (U+200D) are considered to be the characters that can make
                    up a word. You can add additional characters occuring in
                    words here here. For example in german you might set this to
                    the characters a to z, A to Z  and the characters Ä, Ö, Ü,
                    ä, ö, ü and ß. This field is not trimmed, so watch your
                    white spaces.

                    The language these hyphenation patterns are for. You can
                    have multiple pattern sets for each language, but in that
                    case it is undefined which one is chosen.
