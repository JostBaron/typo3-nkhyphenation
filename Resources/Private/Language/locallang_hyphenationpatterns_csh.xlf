                    By default, only the soft hyphen and the zero width joiner
                    (U+200D) are considered to be the characters that can make
                    up a word. You can add additional characters making up words
                    here. These characters are used additionally to the ones
                    defined in the pattern file. If the pattern file does not
                    contain a specification which characters do make up words in
                    the language, you have to set word characters here.

                    case it is undefined which one is chosen.

                    HTML entity '&amp;shy;', but you could need something else.
                    Entities don't appear in the source code as entities, since
                    they are decoded before echoing them out (DOMDocument likes
                    it that way).
