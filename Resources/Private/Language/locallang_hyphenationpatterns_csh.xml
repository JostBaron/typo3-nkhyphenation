			<label index="title.description">
                    The name of this pattern set. Only used to identify the
                    record in the backend.
                </label>
			<label index="specialcharacters.description">
                    By default, only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -, @, the soft hyphen and
                    the zero width joinder (U+200D) are considered to be the
                    characters that can make up a word. You can add additional
                    characters occuring in words here here. For example in
                    german you might set this to 'äöüß' (without the quotes).
                    This field is not trimmed, so watch your white spaces.
                </label>
			<label index="system_language.description">
                    The language these hyphenation patterns are for. You can
                    have multiple pattern sets for each language, but in that
                    case it is undefined which one is chosen.
                </label>
			<label index="hyphen.description">
                    The string to insert as a hyphen. This should usually be the
                    HTML entity '&amp;amp;shy;', but you could need something else.
                </label>
			<label index="leftmin.description">
                    The minimal number of characters in a word before the first
                    hyphen might be set.
                </label>
			<label index="rightmin.description">
                    The minimal number of characters in a word that must be left
                    after the last hyphen is set.
